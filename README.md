# Recrio-AI-Hiring-Simulations
Recrio Simulation is an open source project that demonstrates the core experience of role based work simulations. It is a simplified version of the commercial Recrio product. This repository is meant for learning, experimentation, and contribution, not as a full production deployment.

The goal of the simulation is to place a candidate inside a realistic team environment where they solve tasks, work with information, and make decisions similar to an actual job. The focus is on judgment, communication quality, prioritization, and problem solving.

This project intentionally excludes proprietary scoring methods, advanced multi agent systems, internal datasets, business logic, and integrations used in the production platform.

What this project is

This open source version highlights:

A workspace style simulation flow

Task based and scenario driven prompts

Lightweight frontend and backend example structure

Sample channels and interactions

A foundation that developers can extend

It shows the concept of simulation driven assessment without revealing confidential approaches or company specific systems.
