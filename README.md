# Recrio-AI-Hiring-Simulations
Recrio is a simulation platform that helps organizations evaluate how candidates think and work in realistic job environments. Instead of relying only on resumes or quizzes, Recrio places candidates in a workplace style setting where they navigate tasks, collaborate in channels, review documents, and make decisions similar to an actual role.

The goal is to measure judgment, problem solving, communication clarity, and ability to operate with incomplete information. Candidates interact with scenarios that feel like real work rather than theoretical test questions. This allows teams to understand not only what someone knows, but how they apply it.

Recrio focuses especially on startup and high growth environments where adaptability, prioritization, and tradeoffs matter. The platform emphasizes:

realistic task flows

multi step decision making

role specific context

signal on applied thinking rather than trivia

The version in this repository represents a simplified demonstration of that idea. The full commercial platform includes additional systems and features that are not part of this open source project.
